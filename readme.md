# deprecated, use [Oban](https://github.com/quarterto/Oban)

Livewire 0.5 uses a different API for serving, and is no longer compatible with fantasy-http. [Oban](https://github.com/quarterto/Oban) is like fantasy-http but without the clunky constructors. And being based on [Highland](http://highlandjs.org), it's faster as well.
